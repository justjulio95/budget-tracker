## Description
Budget Tracker is a Progressive Web Application that allows a user to manage their transactions with ease. It allows for offline functionality as well as offline access. When a user does not have access to a stable internet connection, they will still be able to record their transactions and can rest assured that their data will be stored and uploaded the moment an internet connection is reestablished.
